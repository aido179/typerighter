# Type Righter
Type Righter is a writing tool to help writers fill pages without the distraction of editing. Just type, and save your work when you're done.

## Usage
Type Righter will (hopefully) be a stand-alone desktop application using Atom Electron. All going well, it should be available to download on Windows, Mac and Linux.
